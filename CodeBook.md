As part of the Getting and Cleaning data course, I wrote a program that cleans and sorts data regarding a study of cellphone data collected while carriers of the cellphone did various activities.  The program creates two tables from the data.  The columns in the tables are the same as each other.  The rows in the first table pertain to a single observation of a person doing an activity.  The rows in the second column are the mean of aech person for each activity.  There are six persons in the study labeled 1 through 6 and 6 activities like sitting, running, etc.

The column headers are broken down as follows:
time: time series
fourier: fourier transformation
mean: mean of the observation interval
standard deviation: standard deviation of the observation inetrval
body: the affect of the body on the observation
gravity:  the affect of gravity on the observatuion
gyroscope: cellphone device record 
accelleration: cellphone device record 
jerk: cellphone device record 
magnet: cellphone device record 
x: in the x direction relative to the cellphone
y: in the y direction relative to the cellphone
z: in the z direction relative to the cellphone
